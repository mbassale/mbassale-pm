# mbassale-pm: MBassale's Password Manager
This is my own password manager to replace crap-pass services, I'm boring of "subscribe" alerts and browser extensions that doesn't work.  
So I created a desktop statically linked application with an encrypted key-value database to store my passwords.
Then I'll create a react-native app that I'll load on my smartphone to have my passwords on the go.
